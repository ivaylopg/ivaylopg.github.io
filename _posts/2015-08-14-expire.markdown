Sometimes you have to send your app over the internets. Or maybe it's an art installation for a show but you won't be there during teardown. Most of the time, we trust people to be decent and not re-use your app or project without your consent. Most of the time, the people we trust actually are decent and would never do that.

Sometimes though, for those rare times you've got a bad vibe, or if you don't really know who you're working with, or if the needs of the project dictate it, it would be great if your app just expired.

This is for those rare times.
