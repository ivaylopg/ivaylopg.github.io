Luxloop was approached by Creacíon Events to create a unique installation for a 36-seat pop-up dinner during Art Basel Miami featuring food by Michelin Star chef Vicky Cheng and renowned pastry chef Andrés Lara.

Luxloop designed a dining environment with full-room projection to surround the diners and developed a series of short films inspired by Chef Vicky Chen’s menu, transporting the guests to another world based on the dish for each course. The projections were live cued throughout the dinner and responded in real time to the movements and interactions of the guests, staff, and performers within the space.

The films were created using a combination of studio photography, high-speed video capture, motion graphics, 2D and 3D animation to create truly unique and stunning environments.
