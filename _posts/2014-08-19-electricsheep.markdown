A digital cloud built from an algorithm. The daydreams of an android lying in a virtual field of grass.

![cover](http://ivaylogetov.bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/ivaylogetov.com/projects/sheep/main.jpg)

I developed a recursive algorithm that grows each cloud based on two inputs: the number of recursions and the shape of each "droplet." As the program recurses, it mutates, resulting in a unique cloud formation each time.

The final products are a series of high-resolution prints and a video installation in which a computer infinitely loops through the algorithm, producing an endless stream of unique clouds as if passing its time by seeing shapes in the sky.

Prints can be purchased [here](http://society6.com/ivaylogetov/prints?show=new).
