Blue Butterfly is an original play about the clash of science and belief. Funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation *Agora* Grant and produced through the *University of Lausanne* and the *École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne*, Blue Butterfly was conceived to portray a science-based story to a non-science audience.

I was involved throughout the development process, ultimately designing the poster art and and executing live projection-mapped visuals for seven performances across two cities.
